Add full CRUD(S) support for our Issue model.

## Criteria
1. It must be possible for users to create issues
1.1. The user who created the issue must automatically be the author
2. It must be possible to read (single) issues (or see a detail page for them).
3. It must be possible to update existing issues (one at a time)
4. It must be possible to (permanently) delete issues, regardless of status.
5. It must be possible to display a scan of all issues
